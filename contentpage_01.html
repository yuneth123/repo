            <h3>Climate Regulation</h3>
                <p>Oceans play a vital role in shaping climate on Earth, as they distribute heat across the entire planet. Warm currents, like the Gulf Stream, carry heat away from the equator toward higher latitudes, while cold water streams aid in moving cold water back to the equatorial region. It helps to buffer global temperatures.
                Carbon Sink: Oceans are currently absorbing about 25% of global human-emitted CO2, lessening the impacts of climate change. Tiny phytoplankton in the ocean convert light and CO2 through photosynthesis into organic matter.</p>
                
            <h3>Biodiversity</h3>
                <p>Critical Habitats: Our oceans are home to an extraordinary range of life, from minuscule plankton to giant whales. Coral reefs harbor can even support 25% of the total marine species.
                Marine and Coastal Ecosystem Services: Marine and coastal ecosystems provide us significant services, which include food, coastal protection and other recreation. Not only do mangroves safeguard coastlines against storms but they also provide a habitat food source for many fish species.
                
            <h3>Economic Importance</h3>
                <ul id="para">
                    <li>Fisheries: Roughly a third of the world's population relies on oceans for food. There are millions of jobs in the fishing industry around the world; the economy of many coastal communities is heavily dependent on it.</li>
                    <li>Tourism: Coastal & Marine Tourism, the Key Driver of the Blue Economy. The sandy coasts and the turquoise waters, and the warm year-round climate in the Caribbean attract tourists.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Oxygen Production</h3> 
                <p>The ocean produces more than half of the world's oxygen. More than 70% of the gas in the atmosphere that we breathe is generated by the phytoplankton. This O2 is vital for the majority of life on Earth.</p>
                
            <h3>Water Cycle</h3>
                <p>Evaporation and Condensation, part of the water cycle. Oceans cover 71% of the planet and also account for most hydrological cycles by contributing over 80% of moisture for the Earth's precipitation cycle, which drives weather patterns and recharges terrestrial water supplies.
                This section outlines the importance of oceans, coasts and border regions as well as the growing need to consider them as one connected unit when making policy decisions rather than viewing them in isolation. Oceans cover 71 percent of Earth and produce over 50% of oxygen that we all need to live.</p>
                
            <h3>Recent Scientific Advances</h3>
                <p>Marine Environment and Human Health, the impact of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive on ocean and human health research and policy, epidemiology of infectious diseases in aquatic animals, linkages between human and animal health ecosystem services and natural capital modelling, review of pathological processes and functional ecology in the molecular-trait correlations.</p>

            <h3>One Health Approach</h3>
                <p>Fish forensics in the form of a rabbit primary cell-based bioassays indicated the toxicity of domoic and other kainic acid analogues neurotoxins.</p>
                
            <h3>The Future of Healthy Marine Ecosystems </h3>
                <p>Integration of the Understanding of Dynamics and Processes in Future Planning, the importance of furthering our understanding of marine ecosystems will require both traditional ecological and long-term capture-recapture data analyses as well as novel, cutting-edge approaches.</p><br>
